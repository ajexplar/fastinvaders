# fastinvaders
A faster variant of the arcade classic.

Plays as you would expect, using left and right arrows for movement and space to fire. 

You have 3 barriers to defend yourself that can take 3 hits each, and you start with 3 lives. You get an extra life every 5000 points and the barriers are restored every 10 levels.

There are 3 types of enemies. The enemy wave moves increasingly faster as the game progresses and they are more likely to use more complex formations. A fast enemy travels at the top edge of the screen which is worth more points than others.

Your final score is displayed at the end.

I haven't included the images or music in this repo for the time being.

# TODO
* Add a mute button
* Give enemies different armor strength
* Use more specialized formations
* Create a scrolling background
